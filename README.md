# Employee-Churn
Employee churn is a costly problem for businesses. It can lead to lost productivity, increased hiring costs, and decreased customer satisfaction. This project aims to help Bionic Enterprise reduce employee churn by identifying why the employees leaving the company and providing recommendations on how to curb employee turnover.

The project will use the available data to create a Power BI report. The report will include visualizations and insights that will help the Director of HR understand the factors that are driving employee churn. The report will also make recommendations for how Bionic Enterprise can improve employee retention.

# Project Plan
The project included the following phases:

Data collection: The first phase involved collecting the data needed for the analysis. The included information on employees such as department - employee's department, job satisfaction - employee's job satisfaction score, evaluation score - employee performance score, work accident - whether an employee has had an accident at work or not, average monthly hours - hours the employee worked per month, promotion - whether the employee has had a promotion or not, salary - whether the employee is a low, medium or high salary earner, time spent in the company - how long employee has been in the company, number of projects - number of projects the employee participated in, and churn to identify whether an employee has churned.
Data cleaning: The second phase involved cleaning and preparing the data for analysis. This involved removing duplicate records, correcting errors, and filling in missing values using Power Query.
Data analysis: The third phase involved analyzing the data to identify the factors that are most likely to lead to employee churn.
Report creation: The fourth phase involved creating a Power BI report that summarizes the findings of the data analysis. The report included visualizations and insights that will help the Director of HR understand the factors that are driving employee churn.
Report presentation: The final phase  involved presenting the Power BI report to the Director of HR. The presentation will discuss the findings of the data analysis and make recommendations for how Bionic Enterprise can improve employee retention.
